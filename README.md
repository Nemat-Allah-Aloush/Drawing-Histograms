An academic project at HIAST aimed to draw histogram out of data file. The project is written in Java programing language.

## Output Example
In the following picture we can see a screenshot of the GUI of the program. While the input is a file with data about precipitation rate, the output is a histogram representing the data.

In order to explain the format of the data file, we will take an example of data file about precipitation rate for cities in Syria.
The first line should  contain the title. Then, for each city there is the name of it and then a set of lines, in each line there is the year and the precipitation rate.
